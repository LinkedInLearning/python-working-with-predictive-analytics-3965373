## Course Description

<p>Data can tell many stories: where it came from and where it’s going. Predictive analytics gives programmers a tool to tell stories about the future: to extract usable information and make accurate predictions. These predictions, in turn, allow business to make more informed, impactful decisions. Join data scientist Isil Berkun in this course to explore predictive analytics with Python. Discover how to prepare data—fill in missing values, perform feature scaling, and more—and use prebuilt Python libraries to make and evaluate prediction models. Isil describes what models to use and when, and explains the concepts in such a way that you can immediately apply them to your own work. Check out this course and learn to leverage Python libraries like pandas and NumPy and choose the right prediction models for your projects.

<p>This course includes Code Challenges powered by CoderPad. Code Challenges are interactive coding exercises with real-time feedback, so you can get hands-on coding practice alongside the course content to advance your programming skills.</p>
